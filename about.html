  <h2>About Us</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Dhaulagiri Deaf Residential Secondary School</strong> is a specialized educational institution located in the Dhaulagiri region of Nepal,

  <h3>Our Mission</h3>
  <p>
    To empower deaf children with the knowledge, skills, and confidence they need to lead independent and fulfilling lives.
    We aim to break communication barriers and promote equal opportunities through quality education and sign language fluency.
  </p>

  <h3>Our Vision</h3>
  <p>
    A Nepal where every deaf child has access to inclusive education, meaningful participation in society,
    and the right to communicate in their own language.
  </p>

  <h3>History</h3>
  <p>
    Founded by a group of passionate educators and community leaders, Dhaulagiri Deaf School was established to meet the urgent
    need for education tailored to deaf children in rural Nepal. What began as a small initiative has grown into a full-fledged
    academic and vocational training center serving dozens of students each year.

  <h3>Our Programs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Primary and Secondary Level Education</li>
    <li>Nepali Sign Language Instruction</li>
    <li>Vocational Training (e.g., tailoring, carpentry, computer skills)</li>
    <li>Life Skills and Communication Development</li>
    <li>Community Awareness and Advocacy for Deaf Rights</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Inclusive Learning Environment</h3>
  <p>
    We believe that every child has the right to education in an environment that respects their language and identity.
    Our classrooms use visual learning tools, trained deaf and hearing staff, and sign language as the primary medium of instruction.
